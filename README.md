## NYC 311 Complaints Project

This repository contains two main components related to the analysis and visualisation of NYC 311 complaints data:

1. Explanatory Data Analysis (EDA) with R

The first part of this project focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using R. This includes:

Cleaning and preprocessing the NYC 311 complaints dataset.

Analyzing patterns and trends in the data.

Visualising key insights to identify complaint hotspots, response times, and seasonal variations.

The R code provides a comprehensive analysis of the dataset, highlighting essential aspects of the data and setting the stage for further exploration through interactive visualisations.

2. Shiny App for Interactive Visualisation

The second part of the project is a Shiny app designed to provide an interactive visualisation of the NYC 311 complaints data. Key features of the Shiny app include:

Dynamic maps displaying complaint hotspots across boroughs.

Interactive filters to explore complaints by type, date range, and location.

Visualisation of service response times and complaint resolutions.

The Shiny app aims to make the analysis accessible and engaging, allowing users to explore the data in a user-friendly interface.
